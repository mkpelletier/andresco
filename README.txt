Andresco: Moodle-Alfresco Integration by Androgogic

This is open source software released under the GPL3 license.

Andresco is hosted at Google Code:
http://code.google.com/p/andresco

This branch contains customisations to Moodle core code for
Moodle 2.4.x. These are in the form of patch files which are 
applied as follows:

	$ patch {core_file.php} < {core_file.php.patch}

For convenience, use the patch.sh shell script to patch files. 

Note you will need to modify the moodle_home value in this script. 
Also, this is a blanket patch of files, and you may want to review
changes rather than blanket patching files if you haven't done so before.

Please use the Google code project home page to download, provide feedback
and support the project.
